# Project Description
The Employee Directory is an application that produces a list of random users and displays them in the directory. Each users information is displayed with an Image, Name, Phone, Email, and DOB. Upon loading the page, the user can immediately view 30 users from the directory. Reloading the page will produce a list of new users. This display is acheived through an axios API call function to the Random User API.
